    ## ==================== Part 1: Email Preprocessing ====================
    #  To use an SVM to classify emails into Spam v.s. Non-Spam, you first need

    #  implement the preprocessing steps for each email. You should

    ## =========== Part 3: Train Linear SVM for Spam Classification ========
    #  In this section, you will train a linear classifier to determine if an
    #  email is Spam or Not-Spam.

    # Load the Spam Email dataset
    # You will have X, y in your environment
    data = loadmat('C:\Users\pgiraldez\Documents\Octave\mlclass-ex6\spamTrain.mat') 
    X     = data['X']
    y     = int_(data['y']).flatten() 

    print('Training Linear SVM (Spam Classification)')
    print('(this may take 1 to 2 minutes) ...')

    C = 0.1
#     Y = copy(y)
#     Y[Y==0] = -1
#     Y = Y.flatten()
#    model = svmTrain(X, y, C, @linearKernel)
    model = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C=0.1)     # gamma = 1/ sigma
    model.fit(X,y)

    p = model.predict(X)
    
    ta = mean(double(p == y))*100
    print('Training Accuracy: %f' % ta)

    raw_input('\nProgram paused 3. Press any key to continue\n')
    
    
    ## =================== Part 4: Test Spam Classification ================
    #  After training the classifier, we can evaluate it on a test set. We have
    #  included a test set in spamTest.mat

    # Load the test dataset
    # You will have Xtest, ytest in your environment
    # load('spamTest.mat');
    data  = loadmat('C:\Users\pgiraldez\Documents\Octave\mlclass-ex6\spamTest.mat') 
    Xtest = data['Xtest']
    ytest = int_(data['ytest']).flatten() 

    print('\nEvaluating the trained Linear SVM on a test set ...\n')

    p = model.predict(Xtest)

    ta = mean(double(p == ytest)) * 100
    print('Test Accuracy: %f\n' % ta)

    raw_input('\nProgram paused 4. Press any key to continue\n')

    ## ================= Part 5: Top Predictors of Spam ====================
    #  Since the model we are training is a linear SVM, we can inspect the
    #  weights learned by the model to understand better how it is determining
    #  whether an email is spam or not. The following code finds the words with
    #  the highest weights in the classifier. Informally, the classifier
    #  'thinks' that these words are the most likely indicators of spam.
    #

    # Sort the weights and obtin the vocabulary list
    coefList = (model.coef_).flatten()
    weight = sorted(coefList,reverse=True)
    vocabList = getVocabList()

    print('\nTop predictors of spam: \n')
    for i in range(15):
        print(' %-15s (%f) ' % (vocabList[list(coefList).index(weight[i])][1], weight[i]))

    print('\n\n')
    raw_input('\nProgram paused 5. Press any key to continue\n')



    ## =================== Part 6: Try Your Own Emails =====================
    #  Now that you've trained the spam classifier, you can use it on your own
    #  emails! In the starter code, we have included spamSample1.txt,
    #  spamSample2.txt, emailSample1.txt and emailSample2.txt as examples. 
    #  The following code reads in one of these emails and then uses your 
    #  learned SVM classifier to determine whether the email is Spam or 
    #  Not Spam

    # Set the file to be read in (change this to spamSample2.txt,
    # emailSample1.txt or emailSample2.txt to see different predictions on
    # different emails types). Try your own emails as well!
    filename = open('C:\Users\pgiraldez\Documents\Octave\mlclass-ex6\spamSample3.txt')

    # Read and predict
    file_contents = filename.read()
    word_indices  = processEmail(file_contents)
    x             = emailFeatures(word_indices)
    
    p = model.predict(x.transpose())

    print('\nProcessed %s\n\nSpam Classification: %d\n' %(filename, p))
    print('(1 indicates spam, 0 indicates not spam)\n\n')
